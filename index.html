    Facebook (stylized as facebook) is an American online social media and social networking service owned by Facebook, Inc.
    
    Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg with fellow Harvard College students and roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum,
    Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, its name comes from the face book directories often given to American university
    students. Membership was initially limited to Harvard students, gradually expanding to other North American universities
    and, since 2006, anyone over 13 years old. As of 2020, Facebook claimed 2.8 billion monthly active users,[2] and ranked
    seventh in global internet usage.[7] It was the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s.[8]
    
    Facebook can be accessed from devices with Internet connectivity, such as personal computers, tablets and smartphones.
    After registering, users can create a profile revealing information about themselves. They can post text, photos and
    multimedia which are shared with any other users who have agreed to be their "friend" or, with different privacy
    settings, publicly. Users can also communicate directly with each other with Facebook Messenger, join common-interest
    groups, and receive notifications on the activities of their Facebook friends and pages they follow.</p>

        Instagram (commonly abbreviated to IG or Insta)[8] is an American photo and video sharing social networking service
        created by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012, Facebook acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion
        in cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and
        geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content
        by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a
        personal feed.

  Twitter is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known
  as "tweets". Registered users can post, like, and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them. Users
  access Twitter through its website interface or its mobile-device application software ("app"), though the service could
  also be accessed via SMS before April 2020.[13] Twitter, Inc. is based in San Francisco, California, and has more than
  25 offices around the world.[14] Tweets were originally restricted to 140 characters, but the limit was doubled to 280
  for non-CJK languages in November 2017.[15] Audio and video tweets remain limited to 140 seconds for most accounts.
